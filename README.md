# An Alchemist's Zodiac Reader

## What is this app?

This app intends to display the twelve signs of the Zodiac and their approximate Sun sign dates.

## Why are you making this app?

I am making this app to practice the use and understanding of components in React.js along with fellow students of Alchemy Code Lab's September 2021 cohort.

## What are the requirements of this app?

From the [assignment](https://alchemycodelab.github.io/react-zodiac/):

> ## Description
>
> For this deliverable, you will be creating a React app using `npx create-react-app <app name>` and not using a template repository. You will also be deploying the app on Netlify, not Github pages.
>
> The app will load a list of Zodiac signs from a static file and then use a `.map` to loop through them and display a React component for each element on the list. The app should also have a `<Header>` and a `<Footer>` component and component level style sheets. Example of final product can be found [here](https://alchemy-react-zodiac.netlify.app/)
>
> Feel free to use any images you want but icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) are provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b9_epS_8uNdpwrkJZJyrrfgxc4MIMA0C)
>
> ## Acceptance Criteria
>
> - [x] App should contain a `<Header>` and `<Footer>` component with their own individual style sheets imported into the JSX file
> - [x] App should have a `<Main>` component which imports the list of zodiac signs
> - [x] `<Main>` component should map over the list of zodiac signs and pass the data as props to a child component <ZodiacCard>
> - [x] `<ZodiacCard>` should display the Zodiac signâ€™s image, name and dates
> - [x] App should be deployed on Netlify, with the link to the site in the Github repository
